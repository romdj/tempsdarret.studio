# Release Process - Temps D'arr√™t Studio

## Overview
This document outlines the release strategy for the photographer portfolio and client portal platform. We use semantic versioning with automated releases based on conventional commits.

## üì¶ Release Strategy

### Automated Semantic Releases
Every merge to `main` triggers automated versioning based on commit messages:

```bash
# Patch release (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1)
fix(auth): resolve magic link expiration issue

# Minor release (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0)  
feat(portfolio): add client favorite marking system

# Major release (0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)
feat!: redesign project access API
BREAKING CHANGE: All client access now requires authentication tokens
```

### Version Strategy for Photography Platform

#### Pre-1.0 Development (Current)
- **0.x.x**: Active development phase
- **Major changes allowed**: API redesigns, architecture changes
- **Focus**: Core photography workflows and client portal functionality

#### Post-1.0 Production
- **1.x.x**: Stable production releases
- **Backward compatibility**: Required for client-facing APIs
- **Breaking changes**: Reserved for major versions only

## üöÄ Release Types
