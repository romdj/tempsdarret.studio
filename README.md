## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Monorepo Management
This project uses **npm workspaces** for coordinated development across all services:

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
npm run install:all

# Build all packages and services in dependency order
npm run build

# Run linting and formatting across all workspaces  
npm run lint

# Type checking for all TypeScript code
npm run check

# Clean all build artifacts and node_modules
npm run clean

# Reset entire project (clean + install + build)
npm run reset
```

### Testing Strategy
Following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles:

- **🔬 Unit Tests**: Individual service components and business logic
- **🔗 Integration Tests**: Service-to-service event communication
- **🎭 End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows and scenarios
- **⚛️ Component Tests**: Frontend component behavior and integration

```bash
# TDD workflow commands
npm run test:watch              # Continuous testing during development
npm run test:coverage           # Coverage reports for quality gates
npm run test:integration        # Service integration validation
```

### Schema-First Development
Ensuring API consistency across all services:

1. **Define Schemas**: Update TypeSpec models in `packages/models/`
2. **Generate Types**: `npm run build:models` creates TypeScript definitions
3. **Implement Services**: Use generated types for type-safe development
4. **Update Documentation**: `npm run docs:generate` creates API docs

### Event-Driven Development
Building resilient microservices workflows:

1. **Design Events**: Define event schemas in `packages/events/`
2. **Implement Publishers**: Services publish domain events via Kafka
3. **Create Consumers**: Services react to relevant business events
4. **Test Workflows**: Validate complete event flows in integration tests
