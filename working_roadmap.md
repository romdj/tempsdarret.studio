# Working Roadmap 

<!-- TODO -->

I remember there were about 23 different ADRs created, but you didn't have the capacity to create all 23. do you recall what those were? I believe there is one file that contains a full aggregation, if so can you tell me which one is it? Can you continue the split into separate files?

I'd also like to make a direct linkage between the shoot-service event definition and asyncapi, what are my options?  

please replicate all the refactorings made to the shoot-service and apply a mirror structure to the following services:
- user service
- invite service
And please stage and commit per service restructuring

Implement the notification service using Resend.dev. & payload cms (mongodb, self-hosted/community version)
