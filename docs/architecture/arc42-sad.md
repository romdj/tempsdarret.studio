    WEB->>P: Shoot created confirmation

    EB->>US: Consume shoot.created event
    US->>US: Process client user creation/lookup
    alt Client doesn't exist
        US->>US: Create client user (role: 'client')
        US->>EB: Publish user.created event
        Note right of EB: {userId, email, role: 'client', shootId}
    else Client exists
        US->>EB: Publish user.verified event
        Note right of EB: {userId, email, shootId}
    end

    EB->>IS: Consume user.created/verified event
    IS->>IS: Generate magic link token (15min expiry)
    IS->>IS: Store invitation (email, shootId, token)
    IS->>EB: Publish invite.created event
    Note right of EB: {inviteId, email, shootId, token, expiresAt}

    EB->>NS: Consume invite.created event
    NS->>NS: Generate magic link URL

    Note right of EB: {inviteId, email, sentAt, status: 'sent'}
```

**Runtime Scenario Details:**
- **Trigger**: Photographer creates new photography session
- **Primary Flow**: Synchronous shoot creation followed by asynchronous invitation workflow
- **Event Flow**: `shoot.created` ‚Üí `user.created/verified` ‚Üí `invite.created` ‚Üí `invite.sent`
- **Performance**: < 500ms shoot creation, < 5s invitation email delivery
- **Error Handling**: Failed email delivery triggers retry with exponential backoff

## 6.2 File Upload and Processing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Photographer
    participant WEB as Web Frontend  
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant FS as File Service
    participant STORAGE as File System
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant SS as Shoot Service
    participant NS as Notification Service

    Note over P,NS: File Processing Flow: Upload ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Notification

    P->>WEB: Upload photos (25MB+ files)
    WEB->>GW: POST /api/files/upload (multipart)
    GW->>FS: ProcessFileUpload (streaming)
    
    FS->>STORAGE: Store original file
    FS->>EB: Publish file.uploaded event
    Note right of EB: {fileId, shootId, originalPath, size, mimeType}
    FS->>GW: 202 Accepted (file metadata)
    GW->>WEB: Upload confirmation
    WEB->>P: Upload progress complete

    FS->>FS: Start async processing (Sharp)
    Note over FS: Generate: thumb (320px), medium (1024px), high (2048px)
    
    FS->>STORAGE: Store processed variants
    FS->>EB: Publish file.processed event
    Note right of EB: {fileId, shootId, variants: [thumb, medium, high, original]}

    EB->>SS: Consume file.processed event
    SS->>SS: Update shoot photo count
    SS->>EB: Publish shoot.ready event
    Note right of EB: {shootId, photoCount, status: 'ready'}

    EB->>NS: Consume shoot.ready event
    NS->>NS: Send client notification email
    NS->>EB: Publish notification.sent event
```

**Runtime Scenario Details:**
- **Trigger**: Photographer uploads photos to existing shoot
- **Streaming Upload**: Handles 25MB+ files without memory issues
- **Async Processing**: Multi-resolution generation doesn't block user interface
- **Event Coordination**: File processing completion triggers client notifications
- **Performance**: < 30s upload for 25MB file, < 60s processing time

## 6.3 Client Magic Link Access

This scenario demonstrates the passwordless authentication flow for client gallery access.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant EMAIL as Email
    participant WEB as Web Frontend
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant US as User Service
    participant SS as Shoot Service
    participant FS as File Service

    Note over C,FS: Magic Link Authentication Flow

    C->>EMAIL: Click magic link from invitation
    EMAIL->>WEB: Redirect to /auth/magic?token=xxx
    WEB->>GW: GET /auth/magic/validate?token=xxx
    GW->>US: ValidateMagicLink(token)
    
    US->>US: Validate token (not expired, not used)
    US->>US: Create user session (JWT)
    US->>US: Mark token as used
    US->>GW: Return JWT + user info
    GW->>WEB: 200 OK (JWT, user role, shootId)
    WEB->>WEB: Store JWT, redirect to gallery
    
    WEB->>GW: GET /api/shoots/{shootId}/gallery
    GW->>GW: Validate JWT + role permissions
    GW->>SS: GetShootGallery(shootId, userId)
    SS->>SS: Verify user access to shoot
    SS->>GW: Return gallery metadata
    GW->>WEB: Gallery data (photo list, metadata)
    
    WEB->>C: Display photo gallery
    
    C->>WEB: Request photo download
    WEB->>GW: GET /api/files/{fileId}/download?resolution=high
    GW->>FS: GenerateSignedUrl(fileId, resolution, userRole)
    FS->>FS: Validate role permissions (client: all, guest: print only)
    FS->>GW: Return signed download URL
    GW->>WEB: Redirect to signed URL
    WEB->>C: Photo download starts
```

**Runtime Scenario Details:**
- **Trigger**: Client clicks magic link in email invitation
- **Security**: Token validation includes expiry and single-use checks
- **Role-based Access**: Download permissions enforced by user role
- **Performance**: < 2s authentication, < 1s gallery load

# 8. Cross-cutting Concepts

## 8.1 Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses event-driven architecture to coordinate between microservices, enabling loose coupling and independent scaling.

### Event Publishing Pattern
```typescript
// Shared event publisher across all services
interface EventPublisher {
  publish<T>(topic: string, event: T): Promise<void>;
  subscribe<T>(topic: string, handler: EventHandler<T>): Promise<void>;
}

// Example: Shoot Service publishing events
class ShootService {
  async createShoot(data: CreateShootRequest): Promise<Shoot> {
    const shoot = await this.repository.create(data);
    
    await this.eventPublisher.publish('shoot.created', {
      shootId: shoot.id,
      title: shoot.title,
      clientEmail: shoot.clientEmail,
      photographerId: shoot.photographerId,
      createdAt: shoot.createdAt
    });
    
    return shoot;
  }
}
```

### Event Schema Definition
```typescript
// TypeSpec-generated event schemas
interface ShootCreatedEvent {
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  shootId: string;
  title: string;
  clientEmail: string;
  photographerId: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

interface FileProcessedEvent {
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  fileId: string;
  shootId: string;
  variants: {
    resolution: 'thumb' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'original';
    path: string;
    size: number;
  }[];
}
```

### Event Processing Guarantees
- **At-least-once delivery** via Kafka consumer groups
- **Idempotent handlers** prevent duplicate processing
- **Dead letter queues** for failed event processing
- **Event sourcing** provides complete audit trail

## 8.2 Authentication Concepts

### Magic Link Authentication Flow
The system implements passwordless authentication using time-limited magic links with JWT tokens.

```typescript
interface MagicLinkService {
  generateLink(email: string, shootId: string): Promise<MagicLink>;
  validateLink(token: string): Promise<AuthenticationResult>;
}

interface MagicLink {
  token: string;           // 64-char cryptographically secure token
  email: string;
  shootId: string;
  expiresAt: Date;        // 15-minute expiry
  usedAt?: Date;          // Single-use enforcement
}

interface AuthenticationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  user?: User;
  sessionToken?: string;   // JWT with 24-hour expiry
  error?: string;
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  PHOTOGRAPHER = 'photographer',  // Full admin access
  CLIENT = 'client',              // Full shoot access + archive downloads
  GUEST = 'guest'                 // Limited access, print-quality only
}

interface PermissionMatrix {
  [UserRole.PHOTOGRAPHER]: ['admin', 'all_access'];
  [UserRole.CLIENT]: ['view_gallery', 'download_all', 'download_archive', 'invite_guest'];
  [UserRole.GUEST]: ['view_gallery', 'download_print_quality'];
}
```

## 8.3 Domain Model

### Core Photography Entities
```typescript
interface Shoot {
  id: string;                    // shoot_xxxx
  title: string;
  date: Date;
  location?: string;
  photographerId: string;
  clientEmail: string;
  status: 'planning' | 'in_progress' | 'ready' | 'delivered' | 'archived';
  photoCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface User {
  id: string;                    // user_xxxx
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  shoots: string[];              // Array of shoot IDs user has access to
  createdAt: Date;
  lastAccessAt?: Date;
}

interface PhotoFile {
  id: string;                    // file_xxxx
  shootId: string;
  originalName: string;
  variants: {
    resolution: 'thumb' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'original';
    path: string;
    size: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  }[];
  uploadedBy: string;
  uploadedAt: Date;
  processedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Aggregate Boundaries
- **Shoot Aggregate**: Shoot + Photos + Client assignments
- **User Aggregate**: User + Authentication tokens + Permissions
- **Archive Aggregate**: Archive + File references + Generation status

## 8.4 Error Handling and Resilience

### Retry Patterns
```typescript
interface RetryConfig {
  maxAttempts: number;
  backoffMs: number;
  maxBackoffMs: number;
  retryCondition: (error: Error) => boolean;
}

// Email delivery with exponential backoff
const emailRetryConfig: RetryConfig = {
  maxAttempts: 3,
  backoffMs: 1000,
  maxBackoffMs: 30000,
  retryCondition: (error) => error.code !== 'PERMANENT_FAILURE'
};
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```typescript
interface CircuitBreakerConfig {
  failureThreshold: number;     // 5 failures
  resetTimeoutMs: number;       // 60 seconds
  monitoringPeriodMs: number;   // 30 seconds
}

// Applied to external service calls (SMTP, file system)
```

### Dead Letter Queue Handling
- **Failed Events**: Automatically routed to DLQ after 3 retry attempts
- **Manual Inspection**: Admin interface for DLQ monitoring
- **Replay Capability**: Failed events can be replayed after fixing issues

## 8.5 Configuration Management

### Environment-Based Configuration
```typescript
interface ServiceConfig {
  port: number;
  mongoUrl: string;
  kafkaBootstrap: string;
  jwtSecret: string;
  smtpConfig: SMTPConfig;
  fileStoragePath: string;
  logLevel: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
}

// Configuration hierarchy: ENV vars > config files > defaults
```

### Feature Flags
```typescript
interface FeatureFlags {
  enableGuestInvitations: boolean;
  enableArchiveGeneration: boolean;
  enableAdvancedNotifications: boolean;
  maxFileSize: number;            // In bytes
  maxArchiveSize: number;         // In bytes
}
```

## 8.6 File Processing Concepts

### Multi-Resolution Strategy
```typescript
interface ImageProcessingPipeline {
  input: Buffer;                  // Original file
  outputs: {
    thumb: { width: 320, quality: 80 };
    medium: { width: 1024, quality: 85 };
    high: { width: 2048, quality: 90 };
    original: 'unchanged';
  };
}

// Sharp.js processing with streaming to prevent memory issues
```

### Archive Generation
```typescript
interface ArchiveRequest {
  shootId: string;
  requestedBy: string;
  includeRAW: boolean;
  includeProcessed: boolean;
  format: 'zip' | 'tar.gz';
}

// Background job processing for 50-300GB archives
// Progress tracking and client notification when ready
```

## 8.7 Logging and Monitoring

### Structured Logging
```typescript
interface LogEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  level: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
  service: string;
  userId?: string;
  shootId?: string;
  message: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  traceId?: string;              // For distributed tracing
}
```

### Health Check Endpoints
```typescript
interface HealthCheck {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  timestamp: string;
  dependencies: {
    mongodb: 'connected' | 'disconnected';
    kafka: 'connected' | 'disconnected';
    fileSystem: 'accessible' | 'inaccessible';
    smtp: 'available' | 'unavailable';
  };
  metrics: {
    uptime: number;
    memoryUsage: number;
    responseTime: number;
  };
}
```

# 9. Architectural Decisions

## ADR-001: Event-Driven Microservices Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-14  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team  

### Context
The photography platform requires coordination between multiple business domains (users, shoots, files, notifications) while maintaining independent development and deployment capabilities.

### Decision
Implement event-driven microservices architecture using Kafka message bus for service coordination.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single application with all functionality
   - Rejected: Doesn't support independent scaling of file processing
2. **REST-only Microservices**: Services communicate via synchronous API calls
   - Rejected: Creates tight coupling and cascade failures
3. **Event-driven with Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
   - **CHOSEN**: Enables loose coupling and independent scaling

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Independent service development and deployment
- Natural scalability for file processing workloads
- Resilient to individual service failures
- Clear separation of business concerns

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in distributed debugging
- Eventual consistency between services
- Additional infrastructure overhead (Kafka)

---

## ADR-002: Self-Hosted Infrastructure Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-14  
**Deciders**: Business Owner, Solution Architecture Team  

### Context
Photography business handles large files (25MB+ per photo, 50-300GB archives) with strict cost constraints and data privacy requirements.

### Decision
Deploy on self-hosted infrastructure using Docker containers with local file storage.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Cloud-First (AWS/Azure)**: Use cloud storage and compute services
   - Rejected: Storage costs ‚Ç¨500+/month for 300GB+ photo collections
2. **Hybrid Cloud**: Database in cloud, files self-hosted
   - Rejected: Complexity of multi-location architecture
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Functions + cloud storage
   - Rejected: Cost and cold start issues for large file processing
4. **Self-Hosted with Local Storage**: Full control, predictable costs
   - **CHOSEN**: Aligns with cost constraints and privacy requirements

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Predictable infrastructure costs (< ‚Ç¨100/month)
- Complete data sovereignty and privacy control
- No bandwidth limitations for large file transfers
- Custom optimization for photography workflows

**Negative:**
- Additional operational responsibility

## ADR-003: Magic Link Authentication

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-14  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team, UX Considerations  

### Context
Clients need secure access to their photos without password management complexity. Many clients access photos infrequently and would forget passwords.

### Decision
Implement passwordless authentication using magic links with 15-minute expiry and role-based access control.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Traditional Username/Password**: Standard authentication
   - Rejected: Password reset burden and user experience friction
2. **OAuth (Google/Facebook)**: Third-party authentication
   - Rejected: Privacy concerns and dependency on external providers
3. **SMS-based OTP**: Phone number verification
   - Rejected: Additional cost and international complexity
4. **Magic Link Authentication**: Email-based secure tokens
   - **CHOSEN**: Best user experience with appropriate security

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Excellent user experience, especially on mobile
- No password reset support needed
- Natural role-based access through invite system
- Aligns with photography business workflow

**Negative:**
- Dependency on email delivery reliability
- Security relies on email account security
- 15-minute token expiry may be inconvenient

---

## ADR-004: TypeScript and Schema-First Development

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-14  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
Microservices architecture requires consistent API contracts and type safety across multiple services and frontend.

### Decision
Use TypeScript throughout with TypeSpec for schema-first API development generating OpenAPI docs and validation schemas.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **JavaScript with JSDoc**: Looser typing with documentation
   - Rejected: Insufficient type safety for distributed systems
2. **Multiple Languages**: Different languages per service
   - Rejected: Team expertise and tooling complexity
3. **TypeScript with Manual API Docs**: Code-first approach
   - Rejected: API contract consistency issues
4. **TypeScript + TypeSpec Schema-First**: Single source of truth
   - **CHOSEN**: Ensures type safety and API consistency

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Type safety across all service boundaries
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Consistent validation schemas
- Better developer experience and fewer runtime errors

**Negative:**
- Additional build step complexity
- Learning curve for TypeSpec
- Stricter development process

---

## ADR-005: MongoDB Document Database

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-14  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team  

### Context
Photography business data has flexible schema requirements (shoots vary by type) and needs to scale for file metadata storage.

### Decision
Use MongoDB as primary database with Mongoose ODM for business data persistence.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **PostgreSQL**: Relational database with JSON support
   - Rejected: ACID transactions not required, schema flexibility needed
2. **SQLite**: File-based database
   - Rejected: Limited concurrent access for microservices
3. **Multi-database**: Different databases per service
   - Rejected: Operational complexity for small team
4. **MongoDB**: Document database with flexible schema
   - **CHOSEN**: Optimal for photography metadata and rapid development

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Flexible schema for different shoot types
- Excellent performance for metadata queries
- Simple operational model for small team
- Natural fit for JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem

**Negative:**
- Eventual consistency model
- No ACID transactions across documents
- Additional learning curve if team unfamiliar
