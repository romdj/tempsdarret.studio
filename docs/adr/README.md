# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Temps D'arrêt Studio photography platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions made during the development of this platform. They document the context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences of each choice.

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow the template defined in [template.md](./template.md) and are numbered sequentially starting from ADR-001.
