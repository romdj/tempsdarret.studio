# Photographer Portfolio Website - Development Roadmap

---

## 1. Backend Development (Optional/Minimal)

- [ ] Decide if a backend API is needed (for client login, private galleries)
- [ ] If yes, choose tech (Node.js serverless functions, lightweight API)
- [ ] Implement secure file storage & serving (local server or cloud storage with signed URLs)
- [ ] Build authentication backend or integrate third-party (Magic.link, Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Define and secure API endpoints for client-specific data
- [ ] Test API security and performance

---

## 2. Frontend Development (Svelte / SvelteKit)

- [ ] Scaffold SvelteKit project with TypeScript
- [ ] Implement public pages per sitemap:
  - Home
  - Portfolio (/weddings, /portraits, /landscapes, /private-events)
  - About
  - Professional Services (/portrait-sessions, /commercial-photography, /photo-editing-retouching, /teambuilding, /workshops, /company-events, /fashion-photography)
  - Contact
- [ ] Create client login page with passwordless/OpenID auth flow
- [ ] Build client dashboard listing private galleries/events
- [ ] Implement large image rendering and lazy loading
- [ ] Implement secure file downloads (signed URLs or token auth)
- [ ] Add SEO features and dynamic sitemap generation
- [ ] Test responsiveness, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Optimize frontend performance

---

## 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- [ ] Choose IaC tooling (Terraform, Ansible, or shell scripts)
- [ ] Automate server provisioning (OS setup, firewall, Node.js, DB if used)
- [ ] Automate DNS configuration (if self-hosted DNS or integrate with provider API)
- [ ] Automate SSL certificate issuance and renewal (Let's Encrypt + Certbot)
- [ ] Automate deployment environment setup (process managers like PM2/systemd)
- [ ] Version control all IaC scripts and document setup

---

## 4. Authentication & Security

- [ ] Select authentication provider (Magic.link, Supabase Auth, or custom OAuth)
- [ ] Integrate auth provider with frontend and backend/API
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (clients vs admin)
- [ ] Secure all API routes and file storage
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and security headers on server (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring for auth events
- [ ] Conduct security and penetration testing

---

## 5. Deployment & CI/CD

- [ ] Setup GitHub repositories for frontend, backend (if any), and IaC
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Build frontend and run tests
  - Deploy static assets or server bundles to home server via SSH/SCP
  - Deploy backend/API code and restart services
  - Deploy infrastructure changes via IaC
- [ ] Implement rollback and notification mechanisms
- [ ] Monitor deployments and application health post-release

---

## 6. Testing & Launch

- [ ] Conduct end-to-end functional testing (public and private areas)
- [ ] Perform UI/UX testing (responsive, accessibility, browsers)
- [ ] Optimize load times and SEO verification
- [ ] Prepare launch checklist and documentation
- [ ] Go live and monitor initial usage and issues

---

## 7. Maintenance & Improvements

- [ ] Schedule regular backups of data and file storage
- [ ] Keep dependencies and server patched and updated
- [ ] Monitor performance and security continuously
- [ ] Gather user feedback and plan feature improvements
- [ ] Iterate on client portal and portfolio features as needed
