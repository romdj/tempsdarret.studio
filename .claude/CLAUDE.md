# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a photographer portfolio website project for "Temps D'arrÃªt" featuring:
- Public portfolio showcase (weddings, portraits, landscapes, private events)
- Professional services pages
- Client portal with passwordless authentication and invite flow
- Secure photo gallery access and downloads

## Architecture

The project is planned as a photographer portfolio with both public and private areas:

### Frontend (Planned: SvelteKit + TypeScript)
- Public pages: Home, Portfolio categories, About, Professional Services, Contact

- Portfolio Service: public portfolio content management
- Event & Gallery Service: client-specific galleries and events
- File Service: secure file uploads and downloads
- Notification Service: email notifications for invites
- API Gateway/BFF: unified frontend API

### Infrastructure
- Event-driven architecture using Kafka for service communication
- Planned deployment to home server with automated CI/CD
- Infrastructure as Code for server provisioning and deployment

## Development Status

This is currently in the planning phase with roadmaps defined but no implementation yet. The codebase contains:
- Development roadmaps for frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- Sitemap defining the website structure
- Architecture documentation for microservices approach
